Game Overview
When making changes, please write the change in italics with your initials so we can see the change progression.

Game Type
2D top-down turn-based strategy game. We are basing the mechanics on the turn-based model for now, but would like to move to a real-time model if time allows.

The theme is galactic conquest, and is (very) loosely modeled after the board game, Risk. The player will start on one planet of a solar system, winning the game by enemy elimination or having greater dominion by the end of the time limit (this may be measured in # of turns).

Turn Mechanics
For each turn, the player will have the ability to create new units, attack fleets at contested planets, and specify fleet movement. It will consist of three phases and once the phases are complete, the turn ends and the other player's turn begins.

Unit Creation
Unit creation will be based on the amount of resources the player has amassed. They can be created at any friendly-occupied planet, but the length of time a planet has been occupied (total time for both players) will affect the units/material ratio. This relates to how long a planet has had time to develop infrastructure to be productive. Planet control produces more resources, so just controlling a planet but building fleets at an older planet is viable strategy. Right now the units are homogeneous, but the game style might allow for more than one unit type (fighters, corvettes, and capital-class warships?). 

Combat
Combat can be initiated by a fleet that is contesting occupation for a planet. (meaning a fleet from either player can be orbiting a single planet at the same time). If the two fleets are contesting occupation, during the combat phase, a battle can be initiated. This will have a similar dice roll combat system to Risk, but may be swapped out for a dual stick shooter, if time allows. In combat, the attacker has the choice to continue attacking or retreat. Fleets health are measured in the number of units contained. When all the units are destroyed, the fleet is lost and the attacker gains control of the planet along with its resource generation and shipyard.

Movement
Movement is the third phase and is measured in turns. A planet-to-planet move cost 1 turn * the number of orbits to cross. Example: Mercury is the first planet, Earth is the third. To travel from Mercury to Earth would take 2 turns. To travel from solar system to solar system takes (12 turns * the number of systems to cross) - number of orbits from star in both systems. Example: to move from the 5th orbit in system 1 to the 2nd orbit in system 3 would equal 24 (base cost) - 7 (orbit proximity bonus), or 17 turns. Each system will have a jumpgate that are linked together to reduce intergalactic travel time. If a player controls two jumpgates, he/she can travel between them in 1 turn. 

Interstellar movement can be canceled prematurely with the fleet halting at the current planetary location, but fleets traveling intergalactically can only be recalled. Once a fleet has started an intergalactic journey, it the amount of turns spent traveling will be spent returning to the planet of departure. 

Enemy Type
Right now, we have settled on AI to be the 2nd player. The hope is that this option could be later joined by a real networked player, but further down the road.
